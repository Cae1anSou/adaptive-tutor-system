For example, for level 1, tags should be added at least on the section such as <title><h2>. Particularly, changes in the chapter titles that are not very noticeable in the upper left corner should be highlighted; otherwise, if you just look at the four levels written without delving into the text content and the different test questions, one might mistakenly think there is only this amount of content in this chapter.","The programming module is quite helpful, as it definitely implements the auxiliary input function of programming software and has done color differentiation.","When encountering tags like <h1></h1>, the auxiliary input function has not been well implemented.","So far, there haven't been any other issues encountered except for improving the label assistance input.","Very helpful, most general coding problems and Q&A functions can be well implemented.",There are individual instances where the response was not output in Chinese.,No,"I personally suggest combining chapter titles with the progressive knowledge expansion module instead of placing them in the upper left corner of the learning webpage, or appropriately changing the tone of the webpage when the chapter changes to let users clearly know they have entered the next chapter.Is it possible for the exploration module to display all related codes, including CSS, for the selected portion?",3,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,2,3,1,2,6,7,1,4,5,3,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,4

For instance, the ""Open Sample Page Exploration"" section on the homepage could occupy the entire left part. After this module is displayed, then sliding down, it could be the ""Progressive Knowledge Point Presentation"" module. In this way, each module's specific page won't appear so cramped.",It is helpful to understand what kind of code constitutes what kind of image.,There were no difficulties encountered.,The page is still a bit small and it doesn't look very comfortable.,It's good. It helped me understand some basic concepts.,No difficulties were encountered.,I suggest that the layout could be made more comfortable.,I think it's great! It is possible to conduct immediate inspection and correction.,I didn't encounter any difficulties and didn't find any shortcomings.,There are no specific suggestions.,"I think this is the best module! AI can detect the current code situation, make real-time analyses, and the analyses are very accurate. The teaching content is also very helpful, giving the impression of being a teacher.",No difficulties were encountered., I think AI could be more guiding rather than simply providing the answers.,"1. It might be a bit challenging to achieve, but I wonder if it's possible to add more theme colors so that users can have more interactive functions. Then the page colors would look more personalized and cheerful. 
2. On the knowledge graph, I hope to add a small crown on the module to indicate that ""this module has been completed"", so that users can experience the same sense of joy as completing a level.",4,1,5,1,3,3,5,1,5,1,8,1,8,7,6,5,4,5,3,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,1
