I need to manually copy it to him in order for him to help me analyze it. This experience is a bit troublesome,"I hope to have direct functionality so that he can read the code and test results in the compiler without me having to manually copy them.

2025/09/09 5:11:39 PM GMT+8,exp004,male,Computer Science and Technology,2C4 years,Undergraduate C Year 3 (Junior),Yes,"I find it helpful as this module provides multiple options, allowing me to choose content that interests me for learning. I believe this format enhances my learning interest. Compared to other monotonous content, I prefer this approach because it boosts my engagement and motivation to learn.","There are basically no difficulties. The usage is very simple and the effectiveness is excellent, but the response speed still needs improvement.","I think the range of topics provided could be further expanded, or users could be allowed to input topics freely to enhance flexibility.","I think this module allows me to freely choose the elements I want to learn, and the element labels and code are displayed, which helps me better understand their implementation. I also like the knowledge graph in this module, which allows me to jump around freely. However, my favorite thing is the degree of freedom it provides.","I didn't encounter any issues while using it. The only drawback I noticed was the lack of CSS styling and JS node selection. However, the module does offer a feature that unlocks previously learned node elements, allowing users to select elements from previous lessons in other nodes. I think this is a very well-designed feature.","I think this module only needs to expand the selection of node elements, allowing the choice of CSS and JS.","This progressive knowledge expansion module consists of four levels of knowledge cards, with content difficulty increasing gradually. I believe it can effectively assist me in learning.","I don't think there are any issues with the usability, and the interaction is quite comfortable. In terms of drawbacks, I believe the content in the progressive expansion could be more concise.","As for improving the progressive knowledge expansion module, I believe the content could be further streamlined.","I think this programming module is very well designed. It functions similarly to commonly used editors like VSCode and PyCharm, featuring code suggestions, static checks, shortcut keys, etc. Its advantage, in my opinion, lies in its flexibility of being embedded directly into web pages, along with the ability to instantly display front-end rendering results.","I haven't encountered any difficulties while using it, and currently I don't see any drawbacks.",I think this programming module could also add a file tree to enable switching between multiple files.,"I believe the AI teaching assistant module can provide immediate answers to my difficulties and questions at any time.
